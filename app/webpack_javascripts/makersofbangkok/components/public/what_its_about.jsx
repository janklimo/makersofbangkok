            While meetups have no formal structure, we do make sure that
            everybody gets a chance to introduce themselves, speak about
            what they're excited about, tell others about the problems
            they are trying to solve, or need help with. Get instant
            feedback, ideas, intros = the most value out of one evening
            possible.
